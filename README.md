# k-means-p5js
A k-means clustering algorithmus implemented in p5.js

A small experiment, implementing a k-mean clustering algorithm in p5.js

p5.js, a processing variant in js: https://p5js.org/

Inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9991JlKnFmk

It shows the clustering algorithm quite nicely in a visual way. I also liked p5.js a lot.

# Usage
The only thing which is neede is some kind of webserver to serve index.html, this can be done for example by executing this in the directory where this repository is cloned:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Click on the graphics to see how the points get clustered.
