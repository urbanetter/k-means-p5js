# k-means-p5js
A k-means clustering algorithmus implemented in p5.js

A small experiment, implementing a k-mean clustering algorithm in p5.js

p5.js, a processing variant in js: https://p5js.org/

Inspired by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9991JlKnFmk

It shows the clustering algorithm quite nicely in a visual way. I also liked p5.js a lot.
